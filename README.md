# SDP-Analyzer

An analyzer to implement the SDP (Stable Dependencies Principle) theory. You can quickly analyze your npm package here: https://narol.pro/sdp-analyzer

Here's just a simple quote, the theory is as follows:


> Fan-in = Number of classes outside the component which depends on the component.
> Fan-out = Number of classes outside the component which the component depends on.
> 
> Instability = Fan-out / (Fan-in + Fan-out).

> Example: Component A has three classes from component B that depends on it (Fan-in = 3). Component A also depends on two classes from component C (Fan-out = 2). Therefore, the instability value for component A is 2/(3+2) = 2/5.

## Installation

```
npm i sdp-analyzer -g
```

## Usages

### CLI
 
#### To analyze local package

```bash
sdp-analyzer analyze ./examples
```

#### To analyze NPM package

```bash
sdp-analyzer analyze react,vue,svelte,audio-analyser-cli
```

#### Npx

```bash
npx sdp-analyzer analyze react,vue,svelte,audio-analyser-cli
```

### API Reference

```javascript
const sdpAnalyer = require("sdp-analyzer");
try {
  const deps = await sdpAnalyer.analyze("react");
} catch (error) {
  //  handle error
}
```

The results are similar to the following:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "react",
    "in": 195657,
    "out": 1,
    "instable": 0.000005110958918112216,
    "label": "Stable"
  }
]
```

### Extension

The Analyzing rule above based on the number of dependencies or dependents is a simple assessment. 

I think the rules could be much more exact, such as using more data from GitHub stars or NPM downloads to assess again. ðŸ’¡ In that case, it should be called the "Stability Analyzer".
